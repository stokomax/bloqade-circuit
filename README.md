> [!WARNING]
>
> Qrackbind Limitations:
> * Only local builds currently work. The github workflows are *broken* due to python version mismatches between qrackbind and this package.
> * An updated version of qrackbind is needed to support MCH gates. [Pending]
> * qrackbind wheels are only published as github assets. Requires updating the source path in pyproject.toml

Bloqade is a Python SDK for neutral atom quantum computing. It provides a set of embedded domain-specific languages (eDSLs) for programming neutral atom quantum computers. Bloqade is designed to be a high-level, user-friendly SDK that abstracts away the complexities of neutral atom quantum computing, allowing users to focus on developing quantum algorithms and compilation strategies for neutral atom quantum computers.

Bloqade-circuit provides the core components of representing quantum circuits for bloqade.

> [!IMPORTANT]

> This project is in the early stage of development. API and features are subject to change.

## Installation

### Install via `uv` (Recommended)

```py
uv add bloqade-circuit
```

## Documentation

The documentation is available at [https://bloqade.quera.com/latest/](https://bloqade.quera.com/latest/). We are at an early stage of completing the documentation with more details and examples, so comments and contributions are most welcome!

## Roadmap

We use github issues to track the roadmap. There are more feature requests and proposals in the issues. Here are some of the most wanted features we wish to implement by 2025 summer (July):

- [x] QASM2 dialect (dialect, parser, pyqrack backend, ast, codegen)
- [x] QASM2 extensions (e.g. parallel gates, noise, etc.)
- [x] STIM dialect (dialect, codegen)
- [ ] structural gate dialect (language proposal, dialect, passes)

Proposal for the roadmap and feature requests are welcome!
